## Question 1
Trust but verify. We trust that the rnorm() will generate random deviates in accordance with the definition of the normal distribution. For example, we learned in this lab, that a normal distribution with mean = 0, and sd =1 , should only produce values larger than 2.5 with a specific small probability, that is P(x>2.5) = 0.006209665. Verify this is approximately the case by randomly sampling 1 million numbers from this distribution, and calculate what proportion of numbers are larger than 2.5

```{r}
q1stuff <- data.frame(observe = rnorm(1000000,0,1))
ans1 <- length(q1stuff$observe[q1stuff$observe > 2.5])/1000000
sprintf("%1.2f%%", 100*ans1)

# 100% some googling for printing percentage but was straightforward
```

## Question 2
If performance on a standardized test was known to follow a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 10, and 10,000 people took the test, how many people would be expected to achieve a score higher than 3 standard deviations from the mean?

```{r}
