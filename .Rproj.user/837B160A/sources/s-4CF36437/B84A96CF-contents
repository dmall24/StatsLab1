## Question 1
Use R to demonstrate that the mean minimizes the sum of the squared deviations from the mean. Accomplish the following steps:
Produce a sample of at least 10 or more different numbers
Produce a simulation following the example from the concepts section
Use your simulation to test a range of numbers smaller and larger than the mean to show that the mean minimizes the sum of the squared deviations from the mean.
Plot your results.


```{r}
x <- c(7,4,8,5,4,6,7,1,9,3)
testingnums <- c(1,2,3,4,5.4,6,7,8,9)
mean(x)
x-mean(x)
round(sum(x-mean(x)))

sum_sq <- c()
for(i in 1:length((testingnums))) {
  sum_sq[i] <- sum((x-testingnums[i])^2)
}

sum_sq
plot(sum_sq)
# 50%
```

## Question 2
Write a custom R function for any one of the following descriptive statistics: median, mode, standard deviation, variance. Demonstrate that it produces the same value as the base R function given some set of numbers.

```{r}
y <- c(1,5,6,4,8,2,11,13,5)


solvemean <-function(){
  temp <- sum(y)/length(y)
  return (temp)
}

```
