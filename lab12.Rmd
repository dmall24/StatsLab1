```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Question 1 
Should you do a linear regression on this data? Explain

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
Y <- c(10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
X <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19)
q1data <- data.frame(X,Y)
ggplot(q1data, aes(x=X, y=Y))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE)

```

# Response
as viewable in the graph above, a linear regression would be invalid on this data set, as the data set itself is not normally distributed or linear.
